 zepto_sql_project

 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail product data from Zepto to uncover insights such as stock availability, discount patterns, category-level comparisons, and price variations.
Using MySQL, I wrote 15+ analytical queries that help in inventory management, pricing strategy, and business decision-making.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details

Table Name: zepto_v1

Source: Imported from CSV/SQL dump

Columns:
name â€” Product name

category â€” Product category

mrp â€” Maximum retail price

discountPercent â€” Discount applied

discountedSellingPrice â€” Final selling price after discount

availableQuantity â€” Current stock available

quantity â€” Ordered quantity

ðŸ›  SQL Workflow
1. Data Import

Dataset loaded into MySQL using LOAD DATA or Workbench import.

2. Data Cleaning

Ensured correct data types (mrp â†’ numeric, outOfStock â†’ boolean/text).

Verified for duplicate product names across categories.

Checked missing/invalid values.

3. Analysis Queries

Key insights extracted:

Show all products

select * from zepto_v1;


Find out-of-stock products

select * from zepto_v1 where outofstock = 'True';


Top 5 most expensive products

select * from zepto_v1 order by mrp desc limit 5;


Products with >20% discount

select name, category, discountpercent 
from zepto_v1 
where discountpercent > 20;


Category-wise average discount

select category, avg(discountpercent) as average_discount
from zepto_v1
group by category;


Rank products by MRP within each category

select name, category, mrp,
rank() over (partition by category order by mrp desc) as mrp_rank
from zepto_v1;


Second most expensive product in each category

select name, category, mrp 
from (
  select name, category, mrp,
  rank() over(partition by category order by mrp desc) as mrp_rank
  from zepto_v1
) temp
where mrp_rank = 2;


...and many more (total 15+) queries covering duplicates, price differences, and stock analysis.
